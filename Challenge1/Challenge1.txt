Challenge #1

We want you to automate the deployment of a simple web application (e.g. WordPress site) in a cloud provider of your choice. We would like to see the infrastructure choices you have provisioned to host such application using IaC of your choice and the way you automate the deployment of both your infrastructure and application. Make some notes on how you would further “Productionise” such solution.

Brownie points if the application is running.




Summary:
	Simple Web application
	automate deployment of application
	automate deployment of platform
	Application running 24x7
	
Plan:
	AWS Free tier account
	Terraform
	GitHub
	GitBash
	docker
	ECS
	ECR
	SG
	ALB
	EC2
	Launch Config
	
Improvements:
	1) Much more better security
		Actual CIDR range.
		expose https instead of http
		using WAF, guardduty, etc
		enabling audittrail and VPC flowlogs.
	2) Application and DB use. For now I just created subnets and all. But application is not using RDS.
	3) Better error handling
	4) There are few hardcodings which I would like to make it as generic and dynamic as possible
