Challenge #3
=============
You have been dropped into a large ecommerce website (which takes payments) and they suspect they are suffering from an ongoing system attack.

Can you please help them by analysing the attached log file to help the client identify the attack and make recommendations on strengthening their website.

There are potentially many issues in the file, discuss with us your top 3.


Observations and Recommendations
================================
	1) Enable DDOS attack with WAF over it. user Theresa is prime suspect. Her login is compromized. It should be corrected immaditely and asked to change her password and use strong one.
		-> one of the possibilities is that password policy is not strong enough. This needs to be checked and corrected immediately if that is the case.
			This must be like minimum length of 12 chars, must be special characters, must expire every 3 months, shouldn't allow to keep same password.
	2) Admin Access and Admin Operations
		3.0) I notice lots of admin operations performed by looking like genuine users as well. This is not right and safe practice.
		3.1) Admin access should be completely separated than general end user.
		3.2) Admin access should have diffrent DNS/Port/certificate to get access for performing admin operations.
	3) It seems there is no restrictions/validations over what API/Resoucre is allowed with what HTTP method.
		e.g. I can see calls to /login item with GET/PUT/POST/DELETE and success calls.
	4) make sure to use https/tls as well as encryption for payload for payment data.
	5) querystrings / input validation.
	6) API traffic analytics














Observations:
============
	500 - 17 - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
	502 - 17 - The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
	504 - 14 - Gateway Timeout The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting to complete the request
	403 - 16 - Forbidden The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in the entity. If the server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead.
